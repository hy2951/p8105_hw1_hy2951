Data set description This data set contains hourly weather observations
from NYC’s Central Park station during early January. It has 358 rows
and 15 columns. The variables are: origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour. The key variables are `time_hour`, `temp`, `humid`. The mean
temperature over this period is 39.6 °F

Interpretation of the figure: The plot shows temperatures follow a daily
cycle, being lower at night and higher during the day. Temperatures vary
from below 30 °F to above 50 °F. The higher humidity is generally
associated with lower temperatures. And lower humidity is generally
associated with higher temperatures.

mean(pull(df,num_var)) #works
```

    ## [1] 0.07462564

``` r
mean(pull(df,log_var))#works because false =0 and true=1
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(df,char_var))#does not work because characters cannot be averaged
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df,fact_var))#does not work because factors cannot be averaged
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
#convert variables into numeric form 
as.numeric(pull(df,log_var)) # false=0 and true =1
as.numeric(pull(df,char_var))# all variables becomes NA
as.numeric(pull(df,fact_var))# it converts factor level to 1,2,3
```

After creating a dataframe containing: numeric variables, logical
variables, character variables, and factor variables, using the pull
function to calculate the mean value. The results shown as follow: the
mean of numeric variable works. The mean of the logical variable also
works, because R converts True to 1 and False to 0. The mean of the
character variable fails, because characters cannot be averaged. And the
mean of the factor variables fails, because factors are categorical.
Applying the as.numeric shows that logicals are converted to 0 or 1,
characters become NA, and factors are converted to internal integers.
This explains why numeric and logical means work but the other variables
means do not work.
