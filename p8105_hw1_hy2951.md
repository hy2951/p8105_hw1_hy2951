Data set description This data set contains hourly weather observations
from NYC’s Central Park station during early January. It has 358 rows
and 15 columns. The variables are: origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour. The key variables are `time_hour`, `temp`, `humid`. The mean
temperature over this period is 39.6 °F

Interpretation of the figure: The plot shows temperatures follow a daily
cycle, being lower at night and higher during the day. Temperatures vary
from below 30 °F to above 50 °F. The higher humidity is generally
associated with lower temperatures. And lower humidity is generally
associated with higher temperatures.
